Whether you're hosting complex mini-games, timing in-game events, or simply adding more functionality to your builds, this project offers a range of useful features:

- **Versatile Timer and Countdown System:**
Easily set up a timer or countdown for any scenario. From races to timed challenges, this Datapack allows you to manage in-game time with precision. The countdown can be customized down to the second, and there are no limits on how long you can set it — whether it's a short 10-second sprint or a massive 1000-hour countdown for long-term events.

Choose from 16 different colors to match your Minecraft theme, build, or event. Plus a "color wave" mode, adding even more dynamic visual customization to your timers and countdowns.

- **Simple and Intuitive Menu:**
You don’t need to deal with complicated setups or commands. The user-friendly menu makes it easy to start, pause, resume, or reset the timer, and you can even hide it from chat if you want a cleaner interface.

- **Lightweight and Non-Intrusive:**
The Datapack integrates seamlessly into your existing Minecraft world without causing lag or disrupting gameplay. It's designed to enhance the experience without adding unnecessary complexity.

- **Countdown:** This option allows you to start a countdown using a bossbar. You can easily adjust the time via a submenu with options to add or subtract in increments of 1 second, 10 seconds, 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, or 10 hours. There's no upper limit on the countdown, so feel free to set it as high as you'd like—even up to 1000 hours!

- **Help:** Contains credits, an uninstall option, and a debug menu. The debug menu displays the timer's scoreboard in the sidebar for easy monitoring.
